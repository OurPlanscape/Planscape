# Merges input polygons and outputs either ...
#   - a single merged Polygon (if the polygons are contiguous)
#   - a MultiPolygon containing merged polygons (if the polygons aren't 
#     contiguous)
# Input parameter, simplify_margin, controls the extent to which merged 
# polygons are simplified (according to the Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which, 
# for line segments joining points A => B => C, removes point B if the distance 
# between B and line segment, A => C, is below a given margin) -- 
#   - simplify_margin=None means no simplification occurs
#   - simplify_margin=0 means extraneous points within a straight line are 
#     removed while preserving the fidelity of the merged polygon
#     (e.g. (0,0) => (0,1) => (0,3) is simplified to (0,0) -> (0,3) because the 
#     distance beetween (0,1) and the line joining (0,0) to (0,3) is 0) 
#   - simplify_margin>0 will remove points without preserving the fidelity of
#     the merged polygon
# Input parameter expectations:
#   - Polygons in input parameter, polygons, must have the same SRID
#   - input parameter, simplify_margin, must be None or gte 0
