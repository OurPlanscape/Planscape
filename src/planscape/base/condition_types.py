"""Classes (really structs) for describing different kinds of conditions.

In the PROMOTe framework, the condition of the landscape is calculated
through a hierarchy of metrics, elements, and pillars.  The types describe
the metadata of this hierarchy.

Types defined:
  Condition:          2-dimensional matrix of values in the [-1, 1] range.
  ConditionLevel:     Level of the PROMOTe hierarchy.
  ConditionScoreType: Different types of conditions.
  Metric:             Base conditions from the PROMOTe framework.
  Element:            A condition that is the result of combining metrics.
  Pillar:             A condition that is the result of combining elements.
  Region:             Collected pillar conditions of a region.
