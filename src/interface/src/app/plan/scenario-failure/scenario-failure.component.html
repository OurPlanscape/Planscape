      The constraints you set may be preventing the tool from finding enough
      valid land for the run to complete successfully. Please eliminate some
      constraints (slope, roads, areas), and try again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, review your planning area with the primary metrics layers
      for your treatment goal. If the area you have selected doesn’t have enough
      density of the key metrics, the tool won’t be able to find enough land to
      select for treatment.
