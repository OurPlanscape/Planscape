        <p>
          Treatment goals allow you to select one goal that will generate a
          scenario based on your landscape. Each of the goals uses a different
          set of input variables, thresholds and primary metrics to generate
          your result. You can only select one goal per run, however you can do
          as many scenario runs as you choose by selecting different treatment
          goal questions and parameters each time. Hover over the options below
          for full question details.
        </p>

      <div *ngSwitchCase="'CONSTRAINTS'">
        <p>
          Constraints are variables that you can apply to your planning
          scenario. You can choose either the maximum area to be treated OR cost
          per acre. You can also put in your maximum total cost, which would
          likely be your budget. If you donâ€™t put in a cost per acre, Planscape
          will default to $2470/acre, which is the default for prescribed burn
          and hand thinning at this time (it does not include mastication).
          However, you may know what it will cost for the treatment you are
          planning in your area, so you can enter that directly.
        </p>
        <p>Other constraints are</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Maximum slope. The Planscape default is 37%, but that can be
            overridden.
          </li>
          <li>
            Distance from roads. The Planscape default is 1000 yards, but that
            can be overridden.
          </li>
          <li>Stand size</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Small - 4 ha / 10 ac</li>
            <li>Medium - 40 ha / 100 ac</li>
            <li>Large - 200 ha / 500 ac</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div *ngSwitchCase="'EXCLUDE_AREAS'">
        <p>
          Exclude areas are types of land that you can choose to exclude from
          your planning scenarios. If you choose to exclude these areas, project
          areas will not be assigned on these lands.
