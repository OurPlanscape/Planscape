            Below is your list of planning areas. Think of each planning area as
            a folder which holds the scenarios for each of your planning areas.
            Double-click on the planning area to go into the scenario page,
            which will then show you a list of all the scenarios that you have
            run for that plan.

            If you havenâ€™t run any plans yet, get started by either uploading
            your shapefile or drawing your planning area on the map in Explore
            to get started. Once you have drawn the polygon and hit save, it
            will prompt you to name your planning area. You can change this name
            from this page.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can delete your planning area by selecting the delete button. If
            you want to go back to the map view, just click on the Explore
            button in the top right corner of the page.
