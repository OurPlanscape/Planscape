  <h1>Welcome to Planscape!</h1>

  <b>What is Planscape?</b>
  <p>
    Planscape is a new wildfire resilience planning support tool designed to
    bring the best available state & federal data together with the latest
    science to enable better land management. Planscape is built to help
    regional wildland planners prioritize landscape treatments. With Planscape,
    you can mitigate fire risk, maximize ecological benefits, and help
    landscapes adapt to climate change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Planscape includes all data from the

      target="_blank"
      class="link">
      Regional Resource Kit
    </a>
    layers for the Sierra Nevada, Southern California, Central Coast and
    Northern California regions.
  </p>

  <b>What can I do with Planscape?</b>
  <p>
    You can view and explore the landscape resilience planning data on a set of
    maps. You can also visualize this data for the four regions alongside other
    provided data sets such as county and watershed boundaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future Planscape releases aim to give you the ability to create and save
    planning areas, to create scenarios for various treatments, and to
    collaborate with other stakeholders.
  </p>
  <b>Can Planscape actually help with planning?</b>
  <p>
    Yes! A lot more functionality, including the ability to create, edit, save,
    and share plans is coming. The tool will also include integration with
    ForSys to allow planners to output projects that are optimized within
    provided constraints.
