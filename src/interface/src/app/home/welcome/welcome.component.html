      <h5>What is Planscape?</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
      Planscape is a decision support tool designed to help teams doing wildland
      planning identify the optimal areas on their landscape to treat for
      wildfire resilience. Planscape also helps planners identify where to treat
      to preserve endangered habitats and optimize for carbon-related
      requirements.

      <h5>How can Planscape help my team plan?</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
      Planscape allows teams to plan treatment scenarios together, enabling
      people to run scenarios according to their area of expertise. Today
      Planscape uses the
      <a
        href="https://wildfiretaskforce.org/regional-resource-kits-page/"
        target="_blank"
        >California Regional Resource Kit</a
      >
      data, which provides the most recent data for the state. Using this data,
      planners can identify their area of interest and their treatment goals,
      and run multiple scenarios together to identify the optimal treatment
      areas within a landscape. While Planscape is designed for very large
      landscapes, it can be used on projects of almost any size.
