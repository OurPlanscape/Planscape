      <h5>What is Planscape?</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
      Planscape is a free, open source decision support tool designed to help
      teams doing wildland planning identify the optimal areas on their
      landscape to treat for wildfire resilience. Planscape also helps planners
      locate where to treat to preserve endangered habitats and optimize for
      carbon related requirements. Using the latest available data, and by
      integrating the
      <a href="http://forsysplanning.org" target="_blank"
        >ForSys planning tool</a
      >
      for treatment area identification and ranking, Planscape ensures planners
      are using the most up-to-date and vetted resources for their planning
      needs.

      Planscape allows teams to plan treatment scenarios together, enabling
      people to run scenarios according to their area of expertise. Today

      data, which provides the most recent data for the state. Using this data,
      planners can identify their area of interest and their treatment goals,
      and run multiple scenarios together to identify the optimal treatment
      areas within a landscape. While Planscape is designed for very large
      landscapes, it can be used on projects of almost any size. data, which
