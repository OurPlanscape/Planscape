      <h5>What is Planscape?</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
      Planscape is a free, open source decision support tool designed to help
      teams doing wildland planning identify the optimal areas on their
      landscape to treat for wildfire resilience. Planscape also helps planners
      locate where to treat to preserve endangered habitats and optimize for
      carbon related requirements. Using the latest available data, and by
      integrating the
      <a href="http://forsysplanning.org" target="_blank"
        >ForSys planning tool</a
      >
      for treatment area identification and ranking, Planscape ensures planners
      are using the most up-to-date and vetted resources for their planning
      needs.

      <h5>How can Planscape help my team plan?</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
      Planscape allows teams to plan treatment scenarios together, enabling
      people to run scenarios according to their area of expertise. Today
      Planscape uses the
      <a
        href="https://wildfiretaskforce.org/regional-resource-kits-page/"
        target="_blank"
        >California Regional Resource Kit</a
      >
      data, which provides the most recent data for the state. Using this data,
      planners can identify their area of interest and their treatment goals,
      and run multiple scenarios together to identify the optimal treatment
      areas within a landscape. While Planscape is designed for very large
      landscapes, it can be used on projects of almost any size.

      <h5>What’s next for Planscape?</h5>
    </div>
    <p>
      We are constantly updating Planscape with new capabilities and additional
      regional support. Our roadmap includes replacing the current Regional
      Resource Kits with the new California Landscape Metrics, a new Treatment
      Impact module for analyzing both Direct and Indirect effects of
      treatments, inclusion of datasets beyond California, and expanded ForSys
      planning capabilities. Make sure you subscribe to our
      <a href="https://www.planscape.org/contact-us/" target="_blank"
