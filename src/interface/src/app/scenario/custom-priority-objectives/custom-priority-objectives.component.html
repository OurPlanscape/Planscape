  tooltipContent="<b>What are Priority Objectives?</b>
  These are the main outcomes you want ForSys to focus on when identifying areas for treatment — like reducing wildfire risk, protecting species, or preserving carbon.
  
  <b>What happens if you select only one priority objective?</b>

  If you select 1 objective, ForSys will prioritize areas with the highest value for that single objective.

  <b>What happens if you select two priority objectives?</b>

  If you select 2 objectives, ForSys will run a tradeoff analysis between them, providing three different prioritization scenarios that represent different ways to balance the two objectives.
