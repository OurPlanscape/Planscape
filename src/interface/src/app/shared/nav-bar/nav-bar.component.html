              Start planning your scenario to generate your project areas. Enter
              a name for your scenario at the top left, select your management
              question, enter your constraints and select Generate. You can only
              select one management question per run. Note that the run will
              take longer if you select Medium or Small stand sizes, and we
              recommend that you start with Large to review your outputs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div *ngSwitchCase="'SCENARIOS'">
            <p>
              The scenario page lists all the scenarios that you have created
              for a planning area. You will likely have numerous scenarios for
              any planning area. The scenario list provides detail about the
              status of each scenario, including any that are currently running.
              Note that the planning area is shown in the upper left of the
              navigation bar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The left panel gives you information about the entire planning
              area in which the scenario is running: an overview of the planning
              area in the map, total available acres, number of scenarios, the
              region, the plan owner, the date the plan was originally created
              and when it was last updated.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a Notes field in the left panel. If there are notes
              you want to put in about your scenarios or other outputs, they can
              be entered here.

              This page allows you to explore all the data in the RRKs for your
              region. You can select a region from the dropdown menu, and then
              use the selectors below to set up your map(s). You can look at 1,
              2 or 4 maps simultaneously, and select a different set of data and
              layers to visualize for each map. The map area remains constant
              for all maps.
